      <description>Hello ðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m a security engineer @Cloudflare working on the detection &amp;amp; response team. I spend lots of time researching macOS/iOS security, and looking into new network protocols. I volunteer with @wrccdc and we can always use more people/money ðŸ˜‰&amp;hellip;
If I&amp;rsquo;m not at my computer, then I&amp;rsquo;ll be out bouldering or eating expensive food.

      <description>This post is going to be about my experience with the Collegic Cyber Defense Competiton (CCDC) as a general competitor but more as a captain last year.
For those not familar with the CCDC compeition this is an event where a team of 8 students act as the defensive blue team to secure and administer a horribly insecure network. At the same time we start with the defense of this network there is an Agressive and Advanced Persistent Threat (AAPT, coined by @1njection).</description>
