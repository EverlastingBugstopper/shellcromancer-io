## Hello :wave:

I'm a security engineer [@Cloudflare](https://twitter.com/cloudflare) working on the detection & response team. I spend lots of time researching macOS/iOS security, and looking into new network protocols. I volunteer with [@wrccdc](https://twitter.com/wrccdc) and we can always use more people/money :wink:...

If I'm not at my computer, then I'll be out bouldering or eating expensive food.

Reach out via [DM on twitter](https://twitter.com/shellcromancer), or messaging on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/shellcromancer/).
